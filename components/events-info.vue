            <h4 class="events-subheader">Monthly Finale at Tech Alley</h4>
            <p>This is our monthly gathering and meetup at Tech Alley, welcome to all to visit and learn about the projects of the previous month and those upcoming, along with answering questions and presenting updates to our Big and Bigger Plans.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>When:</b> Saturday, 20 August 2022, 11am-12:15pm (3rd Saturday of every month)</li>
                <li><b>Where:</b> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MZbyqzXMAqFUkpdd9">Suite 150, inside Art Square in the Downtown Las Vegas Arts District</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here we present a Show & Tell of projects as they become showable, or tellable. Projects may be web or mobile applications, but may also be other creative works designed to tackle a part of one of the various project topics, or one of the capstone projects. There is also a general conversation at each meetup about the various projects, how to participate, and future plans.</p>

        </b-row>
        <b-row>
            <ul>
                <li><b>When:</b> Saturday, 10 September 2022, 10am Pacific Time</li>
                <li><b>Where:</b> Online and in-person at the monthly Hackathon Meetup</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rather than limiting participation with an Advisory Board or similar, we invite any member of any community, whether in the Las Vegas Area or beyond, to participate in a monthly chat, update, forum, or whatever might happen with each panel meetup. There are no assignments, the meetings are intended to be episodic and so if you miss one, aim for the next one.</p>
