            <p>Each month we add another project topic to the mix, as part of our pursuit of the overall Capstone Projects. The monthly topic focus is valuable alone, but as part of the overall project plan each contributes more value to the whole than each individual part.</p>
            <ol class="projects-list">
                <li><b>Open Transit</b> was the very first monthly topic and aims to bring project development to Las Vegas locals who may themselves use our public transit system, or know someone who does. This is an ongoing project.</li><br>
                <li><b>Open Data Capture Platform</b> is a modification of the second monthly topic, Earth Month, but increased substantially in scope and relevance. The City of Las Vegas has a substantial collection of Open Data datasets published online, this project will aim to enable crowd-sourced open data collection as well as modern methods of software access to these data for creative uses that we have yet to think of. This is an ongoing project.</li><br>
                <li><b>Smart Social</b> is the way a Smart City communicates with itself. Rather than relying on Nextdoor or Twitter or other social media platforms, the goal is to make use of modern and open standards, tools people have at their disposal without requiring installation of proprietary and questionable software or other products, and ideally built with our ethos in mind (this includes language translations and general accessibility). This is an ongoing project.</li><br>
                <li><b>My Vegas</b> is the Human Interface for our Smart City. Rather than asking people to install mobile applications on devices they may not own, we will attempt to build open standards interfaces to Open Data and other services and information so that more people have more access to more information and interaction. This is an ongoing project.</li><br>
                <li><b>vLocal</b> is an essential component of the online and, eventually, offline real-world experience of what we all know as Locals. People who are a part of the communities that are Las Vegas, whether within the city limits, a little bit farther away in Southern Nevada, or maybe much farther away but visiting now and then. Ideally this project (current for August 2022) will focus on secure communication credentials as well as secure online identities to facilitate participation in the various other projects (Smart Social, My Vegas, etc) while addressing concerns around identity compromise. This is an ongoing project.</li>

        </b-row>
        <b-row class="projects-info">
            <h4 class="capstone-header">Virtual Vegas</h4>
            <p>Virtual Vegas is a Digital Twin implementation, making maximal use of Open Data datasets and all of the specific topics addressed month over month, the goal is to enable the smartest of smart applications and other projects developments to enable discovery, learning, and participation in our Smart City. It would be easy to compare this project to something like Civilization or Sim City, and both of those would be valid comparisons, but this project will aim to be a platform on which someone might build a game similar to these, or develop open news tools, neighborhood communications tools, safety visualizations, and so on. The possibilities are endless!</p>
        </b-row>
        <b-row class="projects info">
            <h4 class="capstone-header">Education</h4>
            <p>This is a capstone in the earliest phases of planning and discussion. Early thinking is to enable a more flexible education platform for students of all ages in the Las Vegas area, adapting what was learned during school closures in pandemic lockdown intervals, adaptation to different learning styles, and enabling learning at different rates for different students, especially in cases where there might be a teacher staffing shortage. If Making our Smart City Smarter is the ultimate goal of Code for Vegas Foundation, Education and an educated populace are the bedrock foundation on which this goal is best built.</p>
